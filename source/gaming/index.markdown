Life is a game, and I'm one heck of a player of games.  Since a very young age I've been passionate about gaming and {"I play everything: Dungeons & Dragons, Settlers of Catan, Dominion, and much more."}  My highschool career is when my love of games, particularly analytical games, began.  While years before I had been introduced to D&D by a family friend, it wasn't until high school that I had the resources to play.

Throughout college I spent alot of my time gaming, organized the Gamer's Guild at UTA, and found the core of a gaming group which I still play with, every week, over two decades later.  For a time recently I was a podcaster for a very successful podcast on the [d20 Radio Network][d20] called [Radio Free Hommlet][rfh].  It was dedicated to the [Fourth Edition of Dungeons & Dragons][dnd].  After running that for nearly 2 years, we stopped production and since then I've been playing alot games based on the FATE system.

I'm also an active player on [Star Wars : The Old Republic][swtor], where I play on the Vrook Lamar server.  My primary character, Gisben Chantris, is a Trooper on the Republic side and part of [TheOrderOfSixtySix guild][66], and leader of "Not The Group You're Looking For" (aka NTG).

I played [World of Warcraft][wow] for many years, on the Dragonblight server as Kossic and later on the Earthen Ring server as Poresh.  On Earthen Ring I became a member of the mega-guild Alea Iacta Est. 

On XBox, my gamertag is Gisben.
