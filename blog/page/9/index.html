In the 21 years since that time I&#8217;ve played many games, I have lived through the turmoil of the &#8220;D&amp;D is satanic&#8221; times, but I still to this day play role-playing games on a weekly basis and I recognize that Gary Gygax&#8217;s games helped me define my personality, my sense of humor, and my style of storytelling.&nbsp; I have in fact just returned from D&amp;D Experience, one of many large gatherings of those who play D&amp;D still and who participate in events run by the <a href="http://www.rpga.com">RPGA</a> and was learning about the upcoming Fourth Edition of the game.</p> <p>Gary has not been involved with D&amp;D directly in many years, and the game has moved from being owned by TSR, to <a href="http://wizards.com">Wizards of the Coast</a>, and now corporately Hasbro though still through the Wizards of the Coast brand.&nbsp; I would invite everyone reading to stop and think about the impact this man has had on our world.&nbsp; While not alone, he is one of the pillars who brought about Role Playing Games (RPGs) in the United States.&nbsp; From those games come so much we take for granted, it is from those games we have countless novels, movies, and computer games as direct products, but also indirectly games such as <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="http://lotro.com">Lord of the Rings Online</a> cannot help but acknowledge that the systems used to model those virtual worlds stand on the shoulders of D&amp;D, and as such this man.</p> <p>While I did not know him personally, I believe it is safe to say that Gary Gygax remained a fan of RPGs until his last breath on this planet, and as such I&#8217;d like to take a moment and encourage everyone here to block out some time on June 7th or June 21st to try your hand at the game again.</p> <ul> <li>June 7th, 2008&nbsp; is the <a href="http://www.dndgameday.com/">Worldwide Dungeon &amp; Dragon&#8217;s Game Day</a> where game stores world wide will be opening their doors and running games for any who will be interested for free.&nbsp; This is scheduled for the day after the release of Dungeon &amp; Dragon&#8217;s Fourth Edition and will be a great chance to see how Wizards of the Coast have stewarded the brand that Gary started so many years ago.</li> <li>June 21st, 2008 is <a href="http://www.freerpgday.com/">Free RPG Day</a>, and many of those same retailers will again be running tables of games, this time from a wide variety of game developers not just Wizards of the Coast.&nbsp; There will be free games, and gaming supplies, being given away in most of those stores that day.</li></ul> <p>So I raise a toast Gary today, and send my well wishes to his wife, six children and extended family.&nbsp; And, perhaps belatedly, I thank him for what he has done for my life without ever knowing it. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) have been all the rage in the world of computing for quite a while now, and many companies have had great success while others have had failures.&nbsp; As with all things in life, planning is key when approaching a SOA, and also like so many things, planning must be taken in moderation.</p> <p>Frequent readers have likely picked up on my love of games, board games, console games, PC games, even Tabletop RPGs.&nbsp; I am in love with the dynamic of engaging with a group of people in a fictional model of something. While attending a recent event put on by Sogeti about realizing success with SOA several corollaries clicked into focus for me between SOA and the type of games called Real Time Strategy (RTS) games.&nbsp; This article is the result, I hope you at least get a laugh.</p> <p>I&#8217;m sure more than one of you is now saying: &#8220;Real Time Strategy games are like an SOA?&nbsp; Tim&#8217;s popped a gasket.&#8221;&nbsp; But let me make my case.&nbsp; In an RTS is a simulation of a struggle between two or more people to achieve dominance in a environment with limited resource availability. Most businesses (not all) are attempting to achieve dominance in a market with limited funds and other resources.&nbsp; As such, since an SOA is supposed to digitally represent the core competencies of a business, it is reasonable to say that SOAs likewise are trying to move a business towards dominance in a market with limited funds and resources.</p> <p>Now when planning a SOA, before you&#8217;ve implemented your first service even, you are much like a player who has just started a match in an RTS game.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve likely got a small amount of funding (likely peeled away from one project or another) and one or two developers that you can have begin to work on things.&nbsp; Ah, and you have your first complication as well.&nbsp; The staple of the RTS genre known as the &#8220;Fog of War&#8221;.</p> <p>The &#8220;Fog of War&#8221; in an RTS game is a sheet of black or gray that covers any area you&#8217;ve not explored or cannot see currently because you have no units there.&nbsp; In our comparison, this is the uncertainty of where to begin.&nbsp; Somewhere out there in the fog are high value resources that will move you towards your goal, such as Gold Mines in an RTS or key areas of flexibility which open new markets in a SOA.&nbsp; The problem is you don&#8217;t know where.</p> <p>Hence we come to the first and most important step of an SOA, planning. Different ideas have been espoused for dealing with this dilemma, we will look at those now and their RTS comparisons to see which we think we actually let us win the game best.</p> <ul> <li><strong>&#8220;The Big Plan&#8221;</strong> - Perhaps the most popular with large corporations, this plan states that the most important thing to know about a SOA is exactly how to build it right the first time.&nbsp; In RTS terms, these people want to spend a lot of time exploring the entire map so they know where all the key resources and pitfalls are before they begin to build out their game.&nbsp; The problem with this is cost, not necessarily in dollars/gold (though it can cost that as well) but instead the cost of opportunity. This plan spends so much time planning that it is possible that by the time they&#8217;ve decided to start playing, someone else has already one.<li><strong>&#8220;Just Get Started&#8221;</strong> - In opposition to this idea, many shops (often smaller ones) try to simply start building.&nbsp; They will not explore the unknown areas around them, they&#8217;ll simply start building services without ever getting a lay of the land.&nbsp; Those builders are your developers/IT and they are well meaning, but they are not spending enough time interfacing with business, who cares about the big picture and clearing our fog.&nbsp; The results of this effort may be highly technically competent and well architected, but may be providing the entirely wrong type of resources to drive the business because they are not aligned with business.&nbsp; Nothing ruins a beautiful SOA more than a sudden and unexpected attack from a horde of Zerglings.<li><strong>&#8220;Just Enough Planning&#8221;</strong> - Obviously the key to finding middle ground between these two extremes is moderation.&nbsp; We must gather resources and begin to build, but we also must explore the fog and find new opportunities.&nbsp; What is needed to make both these things possible is a high level understanding of where we want to go.&nbsp; In real world terms, this takes the form of a document which specifies the core competencies of the business.&nbsp; These are the silos that constrain IT&#8217;s development, directing in the way that victory is being pursued.</li></ul> <p>In RTS terms, we&#8217;re trying to make sure we&#8217;re gathering the right resources, so the right types of things can be built and areas explored. As you build to the high level plan, you&#8217;ll be exploring new areas, clearing away the fog and providing details.&nbsp; Will this mean that you might stumble upon problems or unforeseen opportunities? Yup!&nbsp; But that just means you need to plan for change &#8230; but that&#8217;s another post. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great news!&nbsp; When I attended and spoke at the Microsoft SOA &amp; Business Process Conference I was informed that they were recording all sessions to be included in a DVD of the event which would be sent out to those who had attended.&nbsp; Great, wonderful, but not a lot of use to my blog readers.&nbsp; Well shortly there after I received a request from the TechNet team to include my presentation as part of the &quot;Best Of&quot; from event online.&nbsp; I happily agreed, and am happy to report that the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/emea/spotlight/event.aspx?id=84">best of the Microsoft SOA &amp; Business Process Conference can now be found on TechNet</a>, and that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/emea/spotlight/sessionh.aspx?videoid=765">my presentation on Building HIPAA solutions with BizTalk Server 2006 R2</a> is amongst them.&nbsp; Incidentally apparently I received a 5 of 5 rating during the conference, I thank the attendees for being so easy on me.</p>
<p>This talk is actually very relevant to anyone interested in EDI for BizTalk Server 2006 R2 as the HIPAA specific pieces are few.&nbsp; It is a good introductory talk, it is not a deep internals talk but it does cover the configuration and setup of EDI/HIPAA in R2 in some depth.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re interested in this topic and can&#8217;t get to an event where I&#8217;m speaking, this is a nice alternative.</p>
