  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve never been able to get myself motivated to pursue the Microsoft certifications in the past, the value proposition for me as a BizTalk Server developer was never there.&nbsp; First, for a long time there were no BizTalk certifications, and even once they created such certifications I was never asked about them when pursuing positions.</p> <p><a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/PearsonVue_logo.gif" atomicselection="true"><img alt="PearsonVue_logo" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/PearsonVue_logo_thumb.gif" align="right" border="0"></a> But some of that has changed, first I now work for a Microsoft Gold Partner and the more certified people they have on staff, the easier it is for them to maintain that status.&nbsp; Secondly I&#8217;m currently engaged in some internal planning and as part of that it was going to be very helpful if I knew just exactly what was required to achieve the BizTalk certification.&nbsp; Enter TechEd and PearsonVue&#8230;</p> <p><a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/MCTS-BizTalk-Logo.gif" atomicselection="true"><img style="margin: 10px" alt="MCTS-BizTalk-Logo" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/MCTS-BizTalk-Logo_thumb.gif" align="left" border="0"></a> On Monday and Tuesday at TechEd 2007 I had some free-time, some by choice because none of the tracks interested me, some because the sessions I wanted to attend were canceled.&nbsp; PearsonVue had a testing center setup at TechEd and had lowered the exam cost to $50 per test.&nbsp; That was well within the area at which I could &#8220;risk&#8221; the money on not passing, so I decided to take 70-235 “Developing Business Process and Integration Solutions by Using Microsoft BizTalk Server 2006”.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been working with BizTalk Server since 1999 when I was part of an organization doing Alpha and Beta adoption of BizTalk Server 2000.&nbsp; I know the product very well, but I still expected to fail because I have always had the impression that the certification exams covered minutia that you would not encounter in your day to day work with the product.&nbsp; Apparently I was wrong, I passed the exam and in so doing earned the &#8220;MCTS: BizTalk Server 2006&#8221; certification.</p> <p><a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/MCTS-Distributed-Logo.gif" atomicselection="true"><img style="margin: 10px" alt="MCTS-Distributed-Logo" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/MCTS-Distributed-Logo_thumb.gif" align="right" border="0"></a> So since I was pleasantly surprised by what was expected for that exam, I decided to take TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 – Application Development Foundation, which I also passed.&nbsp; That exam had allot of asynchronous questions on it, but I did well enough.&nbsp; So since I was now officially on a streak I went and took TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 – Distributed Application Development, which I also passed.&nbsp; That means I&#8217;ve also met the qualifications for &#8220;MCTS: .NET Framework 2.0 Distributed Applications&#8221;.</p> <p>Finally I did take, but not pass, the Web exam as well.&nbsp; It contains two question areas that I was weak on, and that was my undoing.&nbsp; Specifically it contains questions on Mobile web development, and &#8220;Deployment Scenarios&#8221; which are all about which Wizard/Tool you would use.&nbsp; Since almost all my deployment scenarios for Web are done manually because I understand what each of the files in the solutions do, I was weak on the tools which publish/copy your site for you.</p> <p>All in all, it was a good week, and I&#8217;m pleased with the quality of the certifications from Microsoft.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not going to guarantee you an guru, but it will ensure you&#8217;ve got someone competent at the technologies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;m wiped&#8230;. my first day of TechEd behind me and Party with Palermo complete.</p> <p>It was a great day, particularly the Pre-Conference training I attended by Jon Flanders of Pluralsight and Richard B. of DevelopMentor.</p> <p>I learned quite a bit, I already had alot of the basics down, but the more advanced look into what WF could do was great.&nbsp; In particular I hadn&#8217;t learned anything about Dynamic Change or custom services prior to this class.</p> <p>Jon and Richard did a great job, and I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve planned to attend most of Jon&#8217;s session for the rest of the week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spoke recently at <a href="http://DallasCodeCamp.com">Dallas Code Camp 2</a> about C# 3.0 and the new language features it contains.&nbsp; Most of the buzz on the net has been about LINQ, understandably, but as <a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/2007/03/21/Extension+Methods+TimRayburnExtensions+Beta+V01.aspx">I&#8217;ve mentioned here before I really, really, dig extension methods</a>.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve spent a good bit of time thinking about uses for them, and looking at how Microsoft has used them in .NET 3.5.</p> <p>One of the things that didn&#8217;t click the first time I played with extension methods which you might have missed to is that you do not have to extend classes, you can extend interfaces.&nbsp; Think about that a moment, you can write methods, with functionality, that act upon interfaces.</p> <p>For example <a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/2006/10/12/Model+View+Presenter.aspx">I&#8217;ve previously spoken here about the Model View Presenter pattern</a>, which is normally implemented with an Interface (The View), a Data Access Object (The Model), and a class to map between them (The Presenter).&nbsp; &#8220;The Presenter&#8221; takes &#8220;The View&#8221; in it&#8217;s constructor and simply acts upon &#8220;The View&#8221; in it&#8217;s methods.&nbsp; &#8220;The View&#8221; is implemented as an interface because you can have multiple interfaces, but this requires another class for &#8220;The Presenter&#8221; because interfaces can&#8217;t contain any code.&nbsp;<strong> Until Now.</strong></p> <p>With extension methods it becomes perfectly possible to forgo the need for a Presenter class in favor of a set of extension methods.&nbsp; Does this save typing?&nbsp; No, in all likelihood you&#8217;ve not save many keystrokes when writing your Presenter but you have gotten rid of the need to ever declare the Presenter on your pages/forms at all.&nbsp; If you implement IDisplayBlogPost on your ASP.NET page, then if you extend that interface with a method called &#8220;public static GetBlogPostByTitle(this IDisplayBlogPost view, string title)&#8221; then your page now has that method itself, and a simple &#8220;this.GetBlogPostByTitle(blogTitle);&#8221; can result in population of your page.</p> <p>This essentially brings to .NET the power of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance">Multiple Inheritance</a> without the problems with Multiple Inheritance that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_%28programming_language%29">exist</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">in</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">certain</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System">other</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logtalk">languages</a>.</p> <p>I&#8217;m still downloading Beta 1 of Orcas, but rest assured code samples for this are coming.</p>
