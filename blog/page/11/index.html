In case you are not aware, Sogeti is a division of Capgemini which focuses on regional IT services delivery.&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; It means our consultants don&#8217;t travel (for the most part) and are placed at positions within their home cities.&nbsp; </p> <p>We have at Sogeti one of the best work/life balance benefit packages I&#8217;ve ever encountered in the industry, here are some details:</p> <ul> <li>All full-time employee consultants are salaried, W2 employees.&nbsp; We are a consultancy, not a contracting body shop.&nbsp; Rolling off a project with a client results in bench time at the office while sales places you at the next client, not the end of your time at Sogeti.</li> <li>Medical and Dental Insurance paid for the consultant, plus the option of a Health Savings Account which allows you to save money towards any sort of &#8220;out of pocket&#8221; medical expenses, even over the counter drugs, with pre-tax dollars.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t use the money, it rolls over year to year, and becomes yours to do with as you wish at retirement age.</li> <li>Comp-Time for every billable hour over 40 worked in a week.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve all had that nasty 60 hour a week project, they for the most part cannot be avoided, but with this plan you would earn 20 hours of Comp-Time per week to use to spend time with your family when work was less crazy.&nbsp; They reward time with time, not money, and that is key.</li> <li>Three weeks of PTO for the first two years, four weeks after that (it goes up again but I forget when).&nbsp; Also twice per year you can purchase a week of PTO, meaning you could have as much as 5 weeks of PTO in your first year and that is not factoring in Comp-Time.</li></ul> <p>What sort of folks are we looking for you ask?&nbsp; .NET Developers of all levels but if you have experience with any of the following technologies that would definitely help:</p> <ul> <li>BizTalk Server - We&#8217;ve got the premiere BizTalk practice in the area and would love to welcome more talented developers into the fold.</li> <li>Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server 2007 aka MOSS 2007 - A hot technology at the moment and <strong>the</strong> emerging enterprise web technology.&nbsp; If you&#8217;ve work with Sharepoint, drop me a line.</li></ul> <p>So are you interested?&nbsp; Drop me a line at <a href="mailto:Tim@TimRayburn.net">Tim@TimRayburn.net</a> with your resume attached and I&#8217;ll get you in touch with the right people to start the process.&nbsp; Remember, life is to short to do something you don&#8217;t enjoy completely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Scott Watermasysk, of .Text and <a href="http://www.communityserver.org">Community Server</a> fame, has a <a href="http://simpable.com/software/1000-loc/">post</a> on his <a href="http://simpable.com/">new blog</a> which talks about the start of his current project at <a href="http://www.telligent.com">Telligent</a> called <a href="http://www.graffitiCMS.com">Graffiti</a>.&nbsp; In it he discusses his opinion that if a first version of your project cannot be accomplished in under 1,000 lines of code, then it probably is being over-engineered from the get go.</p> <p>Key to this premise though is the idea that you re-use pieces produced by others in order to avoid writing your own code.&nbsp; He discusses a large variety of other libraries which Graffiti uses, or used in the first few releases.&nbsp; Some have been replaced, some are still used, but the point is something that is discussed in &#8220;agile&#8221; circles quite a bit and circles around lots of catch phrases like &#8220;Release Often&#8221;, &#8220;Keep It Simple&#8221;, &#8220;YAGNI&#8221; and the like.&nbsp; What I particularly like about Scott&#8217;s example is that it is a stand against &#8220;Not Created Here&#8221; which is a horrific airborne virus that many corporate IT departments have caught.</p> <p>How many things that you&#8217;ve written code for do you know for a fact have been solved before and you&#8217;re re-writing simply yo re-write?&nbsp; Data Access, yup.&nbsp; ORM, yup. Security, yup. Nearly every problem has been solved before, and using an existing library does not diminish the value of your project in fact it increases it because your &#8220;Time to Market&#8221; will be much higher.</p> <p>Go read Scott&#8217;s post, and when your done riddle me this dear reader : What is the biggest piece of code have you personally written that you know you shouldn&#8217;t have?&nbsp; Mine is easy, I&#8217;ve re-engineered an entire Rules Engine when BizTalk Server&#8217;s Rules Engine was available to me.&nbsp; That was a big piece of code, like 3 developers for 4 months kind-of big.&nbsp; Live and learn.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img id="id" src="https://partner.microsoft.com/binary/US/40046689"></p> <p>My friend <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig/archive/2007/11/09/microsoft-central-region-who-and-where-are-you.aspx">Chris Koenig&nbsp;recently put up a post called &#8220;Microsoft Central Region - Who (and where) are you?&#8221;</a> in which he shared the above image which I thought was worth re-sharing here.&nbsp; So what does this image show?&nbsp; It shows the &#8220;sub areas&#8221; within Microsoft&#8217;s Central Region where the Evangelism teams focus.&nbsp; Chris, our Developer Evangelist from Dallas, covers Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana.&nbsp; Recently they&#8217;ve added some help for him in the geographically vast area via J Sawyer based in Houston.&nbsp; Both Houston and Dallas are huge markets for Microsoft and as such having a DE based in each of these cities will help run Chris a little less ragged.</p> <p>Now, many of my readers are based in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and we&#8217;re spoiled because we <strong>see</strong> Chris on a regular basis because he is based here.&nbsp; But it is important to remember that he&#8217;s just as responsible for the Little Rock, or Northwest Arkansas groups (not to mention Lubbock group) as he is for those in D/FW.</p> <p>I was reviewing this map and realized that in the last several week&#8217;s I&#8217;ve hit most of these areas, in fact all but the &#8220;Midwest Area&#8221;.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve covered:</p> <ul> <li>North Central</li> <ul> <li>Minneapolis BizTalk 2006 R2 Launch</li> <li>Heartland Developer Conference</li></ul> <li>Heartland Area</li> <ul> <li>Memphis Day of .NET</li></ul> <li>South Central</li> <ul> <li>Little Rock .NET User Group</li> <li>VSLive! Austin</li> <li>Houston BizTalk 2006 R2 Launch</li></ul></ul> <p>Here is what I can tell you after all traveling:</p> <ul> <li>My favorite Marriott hotel chain is the Fairfield Inn chain.&nbsp; Good breakfast (unlike Courtyards) and bright, happy rooms.</li> <li>My wife believes I&#8217;ve forgotten how to get home.</li> <li>My boss believes I&#8217;ve forgotten I&#8217;m a billable consultant.</li> <li>I believe that I&#8217;m seriously looking forward to vacation next week.</li></ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the keynote at the SOA &amp; BP Conference did a slightly better job of setting down exactly what the tenets of Project Oslo are than the material I had previously received.&nbsp; Basically there are two &#8220;big bets&#8221;:</p> <ul> <li>Services - The phrase &#8220;Doubling down on services&#8221; was the catch phrase, but in short the innovation level that drove the creation of WCF will not be slackening, but instead it will not begin to roll across the whole server line.&nbsp; This is how server products will expose themselves is the message.&nbsp; Good to hear, but slow in the coming.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to be a rev or two for many of these server products before they have WCF hooks built in.</li> <li>Model - Microsoft will ship a unified modelling tool which will cut the vertical slice from development to management.&nbsp; The demos were incredible, the visualizations sharp, and it will all be stored in a single common repository.&nbsp; Out-stand-ing.&nbsp; If they can deliver on this, it will change the game.</li></ul> <p>Obviously this will engage a large number of teams at Microsoft, and as such there is risk involved in their delivery of it.&nbsp; Further a slick demo is easy, and I look forward to playing with the actual CTPs which have been promised &#8220;next year&#8221; to be able to actually work with this myself.</p>
