  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve had a little utility I&rsquo;ve used on my consulting gigs from time to time that I wrote a while back, and I&rsquo;ve finally decided it needed a home of its own.&nbsp; As you can read below, it allows me to keep fairly complex pre-built project structures, and then duplicate them with a click of a button, renaming them to whatever I need.&nbsp; You can <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/clone/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=23298">download the latest release</a>, or you can <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/clone">check out the project on CodePlex</a>.</p>
<p><b>Project Description</b> <br />
A utility to allow you to clone an existing solution, renaming it as you do so, and updating references inside the various files.</p>
<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>Do you have a favorite project structure you setup every single time you start a new project? I surely did, and I got tired of having to re-create that structure every time. Especially since my structure was a complex many levels deep set of build files and other support files and projects I used when implementing the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/biztalkdeployment">BizTalk Deployment Framework</a>.</p>
<h4>The Solution</h4>
<p>Tired of that work, because I&#8217;m a lazy programmer, I created this project that would duplicate an existing solution directory. I setup an archive project called SolutionNameHere, which contained projects like SolutionNameHere.Orchestrations, and then let this program translate every reference to &quot;SolutionNameHere&quot; in either a path or a filename (or even some file contents) to whatever new name I wanted.</p>
<h4>File Types</h4>
<p>At the current time, Solution Clone is aware of the following types of files within your projects that it does more than simply rename and move. These files will be modified to update any references to the old solution name as they are moved. These file types currently include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>.sln - Visual Studio Solution Files</li>
    <li>.vbproj - Visual Basic Project Files</li>
    <li>.csproj - C# Project Files</li>
    <li>.build - Build files used by NAnt and other build mechanisms</li>
    <li>.nant - NAnt scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>This list will almost certainly be updated in future versions to include other types of files.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://stevesmithblog.com/blog">Steve Smith</a> recently <a href="http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/idisposable-and-wcf">posted about the problem</a> of the Close() (or Dispose()) method throwing an exception in WCF.&#160; He proposed a solution that was an extension method to the ICommunicationObject interface and handled safely closing the connection.&#160; Now, if you read my blog you likely know I love Extension Methods, and even more so love them on Interfaces, but his code resulted in a usage like this:</p>  <div class="csharpcode">   <pre class="alt">var myClient = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ServiceClient();</pre>

  <pre><span class="kwrd">try</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt">{</pre>

  <pre>  <span class="kwrd">int</span> someValue = myClient.GetSomeValue();</pre>

  <pre class="alt">}</pre>

  <pre><span class="kwrd">finally</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt">{</pre>

  <pre>  myClient.CloseConnection(); <span class="rem">// extension method</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt">}</pre>

  <pre>&#160;</pre>
</div>

<p><style type="text/css">

.csharpcode, .csharpcode pre
{
	font-size: small;
	color: black;
	font-family: consolas, &#8220;Courier New&#8221;, courier, monospace;
	background-color: #ffffff;
	/*white-space: pre;*/
}
.csharpcode pre { margin: 0em; }
.csharpcode .rem { color: #008000; }
.csharpcode .kwrd { color: #0000ff; }
.csharpcode .str { color: #006080; }
.csharpcode .op { color: #0000c0; }
.csharpcode .preproc { color: #cc6633; }
.csharpcode .asp { background-color: #ffff00; }
.csharpcode .html { color: #800000; }
.csharpcode .attr { color: #ff0000; }
.csharpcode .alt 
{
	background-color: #f4f4f4;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0em;
}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>This is ok, but as he noted doesn’t actually save you much over a using() block except that the error is not thrown from a closing brace, which is confusing.&#160; But if you look at this code, it is a classic example of a Hole In The Middle.&#160; We want to do some common setup, and common tear down, but do something different in the middle.&#160; The easiest way to get around Hole In The Middle problems in C# is to use lambdas.&#160; But of course we want to do this in a way that is easy, and preserves our type safety.</p>

<p>So I sat down with Visual Studio, and after about 15 minutes came up with this:</p>

<div class="csharpcode">
  <pre class="alt">        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> TResult SafeExecution&lt;TExtension, TResult&gt;</pre>

  <pre>            (<span class="kwrd">this</span> TExtension myServiceClient, </pre>

  <pre class="alt">            Func&lt;TExtension, TResult&gt; serviceAction)</pre>

  <pre>            <span class="kwrd">where</span> TExtension : ICommunicationObject</pre>

  <pre class="alt">        {</pre>

  <pre>            TResult outValue;</pre>

  <pre class="alt">&#160;</pre>

  <pre>            <span class="kwrd">try</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt">            {</pre>

  <pre>                outValue = serviceAction.Invoke(myServiceClient);</pre>

  <pre class="alt">            }</pre>

  <pre>            <span class="kwrd">finally</span></pre>

  <pre class="alt">            {</pre>

  <pre>                myServiceClient.CloseConnection();</pre>

  <pre class="alt">            }</pre>

  <pre>&#160;</pre>

  <pre class="alt">            <span class="kwrd">return</span> outValue;</pre>

  <pre>        }</pre>
</div>

<p><style type="text/css">

}
.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>This solution <a href="http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/idisposable-and-wcf">uses the CloseConnection extension method Steve created</a>, but results in a usage that looks like this:</p>

.csharpcode .lnum { color: #606060; }</style>As you can see, this is a more compact, but still type-safe way of addressing this problem and does so with an Extension Method so you can re-use this code in any project you encounter.</p>

<p>This is a new solution to me, so I’m certainly open to comments, but I think it is an elegant solution.&#160; What do you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I had a chance today to attend a session given Anders Hejlsberg on C# 4.0, and beyond.&nbsp; Honestly I walked out of the session going &#8230; that&#8217;s it?&nbsp; The feature list started with the dynamic keyword, which is cool but simply does not help the 80% of C# developers today.&nbsp; Most C# developers today are so bound to type safety that dynamic will give them even more heartburn than var did.&nbsp; Now in reality it will likely make scenarios like property movement from service contracts to domain objects easier, but all its really doing is the same thing I blogged about the other day when working against .NET types, just with more layers and interfaces so that it can be built into the language directly.</p> <p>The next big thing mentioned was Named and Missing parameters.&nbsp; In the talk be mentioned that these should have been there long ago and he&#8217;s absolutely right about that. As such, you&#8217;ll get no big congratulations from me.</p> <p>What else?&nbsp; Co-variance and Contra-variance of course &#8230; a couple of things on this.&nbsp; First, I don&#8217;t think a lot of people will care.&nbsp; Second, perhaps I&#8217;m slow but I have no idea why a new keyword is needed for this.&nbsp; If a type is being used only as an input, then the compiler can detect that and add the &#8220;in&#8221; keyword, and if it is output only, then add &#8220;out&#8221;.&nbsp; Why do I need to personally decorate this?&nbsp; Are their edge cases? Probably, but then have an opt-out model where you can take direct control only if needed.</p> <p>The C# 5.0 stuff about the compiler as a service is &#8230; sexy.&nbsp; That is a concept that excites me, but that&#8217;s just teaser stuff right now and they have no idea how/when they&#8217;ll deliver.&nbsp; But what about other stuff?&nbsp; How about extension properties?&nbsp; What about interface inference (which is a major step towards duck typing)?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t see a bunch of &#8220;type safe&#8221; enterprise developers getting excited about C# 4.0 as presented.&nbsp; They might think its cool, but will they use it like they use automatic properties or LINQ?&nbsp; I think not.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:a4d4deee-d388-4fe6-ab6b-6314e05e975b" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/pdc2008" rel="tag">pdc2008</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/C#" rel="tag">C#</a></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://timrayburn.net/blog/give-back-with-kiva-and-givecamp/">Just a quick update</a>, that several of the micro-finance loans I made as part of the GiveCamp Kiva team have recently made their first payment back, which allowed me to begin to re-invest most of those funds in another loan.&nbsp; I&#8217;m backing the Yon Dial 2 Group, from Senegal.&nbsp; Here are their details:</p> <blockquote> <p>Palmarin (http://www.sem-fund.org/palmarinfr.php) is a village rich in fruits and vegetables. Nevertheless, lack of structures specialized in transformation incite people to import fruit and vegetables juices at very high cost. This why this group of women, confronted with difficulties in conserving and disposing of fresh products (cabbages, tomatoes, carrots) are seeking a Kiva loan to create a local fruit and vegetable transformation unit. They will sell the transformed products to touristic businesses and meet a large customer demand.</p></blockquote> <p>Remember if you&#8217;ve like to become part of the GiveCamp lending team at Kiva and help make a difference around the world for less than the cost of a video game, <a href="http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam?team_id=1299">then check out the team here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever had two objects, of different types, and wished that C# could just be smart enough to realize that objA.FirstName should be assigned to objB.FirstName?&nbsp; For me this comes up quite a bit when working with WCF services.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want a service to directly expose my internal business object type, because that type might change on a different schedule than that of my data contract.&nbsp; So I often end up with objects that have identical property names, usually the service being a subset of the internal class, but obviously of different types.&nbsp; How can I handle assigning objDC from objInternal without writing a line of code (or generating a line of code) for every single property?&nbsp; Enter AssignFrom &#8230; with this code, you&#8217;ll get something as simple as objDC.AssignFrom(objInternal);</p><pre class="csharpcode"><span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
