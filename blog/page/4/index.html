  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some time back I teased about something called Round Table, and the time has come to let the lid off of the idea.&#160; Round Table is an idea that some of my friends and I are putting out there, a model which we believe in and are open to discussing with others.</p>  <p><strong><u>Round Table&#8217;s Mission</u></strong></p>  <p><b>Round Table</b> seeks to improve the lives of our members through a focus on mentorship, accountability, and personal relationships.</p>  <p>We seek to live lives of constant learning through mentorship. It is our highest desire to see members grow together both by sharing knowledge, and openly discussing areas in need of growth.</p>  <p>We acknowledge that speaking openly about goals and challenges brings accountability. Our members should help each other to achieve dreams, and to develop the skills necessary to conquer challenges.</p>  <p>We hope to forge lasting personal relationships. As we support each other, we build trust and camaraderie that can last a lifetime.</p>  <p><strong><u>Is Round Table A Group?</u></strong></p>  <p>No, Round Table is a template for groups.&#160; Unlike most User Groups, Round Table seeks to lay out a plan based on mentorship.&#160; We expect some of you out there will either start your own group, or join one that someone else starts.</p>  <p><strong><u>But, there isn&#8217;t anything about technology in that statement?!?</u></strong></p>  <p>You are correct.&#160; We believe these principles transcend technology, and encourage the formation of groups under the Round Table banner which are related to any field or interest.</p>  <p><strong><u>Are there dues, or something?</u></strong></p>  <p>No, all we ask for now is that if you are interested in founding a Round Table group that you send an email to <a href="mailto:RoundTable@TimRayburn.net">RoundTable@TimRayburn.net</a> and let us know about your group.&#160; If the idea takes off, we will at least have a list of groups.</p>  <p><strong><u>Are you going to found a group Tim?</u></strong></p>  <p>Already have!</p>  <p><b>Round Table Craftsmen</b> is our first such group, focused on those in the software development profession. We seek to grow our skills as technologists, and share those skills with others, while achieving our professional and personal goals. We will meet monthly to work on software and discuss our goals and challenges. If you would like to join us, we encourage you to speak to one of our members:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://timrayburn.net">Tim Rayburn</a></li>    <li><a href="http://jaysmith.us">Jay Smith</a></li>    <li><a href="http://devlinliles.com/">Devlin Liles</a></li>    <li><a href="http://csjackson.github.com/">Chris Jackson</a></li> </ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So my new apprentice is hard at work trying to master all of the nooks and crannies of the .NET Framework, and it has forced me to think about how one teaches something this immense.&#160; One of the things most professional developers take for granted is how much of the .NET Framework they have memorized.&#160; Rote memorization of things like how to split a pipe delimited string into an array plays a huge factor in confidence and speed when we work as developers.&#160; But like trained martial artists, once these maneuvers become second nature, we don’t think about them.&#160; A black belt does not spend time thinking about throwing a block, he throws the block and then <strong>thinks</strong> about the level of force with which to respond.</p>  <p>So in thinking through this, and re-reading about <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/">Coding Katas</a>, or as my friend <a href="http://saraford.net/2010/01/17/coding-is-not-kata/">Sara Ford would writely call then Coding Kumite</a>, I realized that what I needed for Chris was Coding Kihon (seriously go read that excellent article, I’ll wait).</p>  <p>Out of this was born <a href="https://github.com/roundtable/Squire">Squire</a>, a basic drill that can be repeated that will train the user on various aspects of the syntax and framework libraries of .NET.&#160; At the current time it contains only two Kihon classes, specifically on System.String and System.Console.&#160; I expect this will grow rapidly over the next few weeks.</p>  <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/roundtable/Squire">grab the latest code at github</a>, and be sure to check out the <a href="https://github.com/roundtable/Squire/wiki">Wiki section</a> for my recommendations on how to use the library in drills.</p>  <p>Oh … and if you’re curious what the Round Table part is all about … you’ll just have to wait a little longer, as that is the topic of another post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Writing great software is an immense joy in my life.&#160; I truly enjoy working with business users and other developers to craft software which can make a marked and immediate difference for a business, something that presents real value.&#160; There isn’t a lot of rocket science here, it goes to the fundamental desire of all humans to make a difference in our world.</p>  <p>Fortunately for those who are looking for ways to do so, our world is full of situations that need to be adjusted.&#160; One of them, with all due respect to those in our industry who cling to their cherished degrees from universities, is that <strong>you do not need a four year degree to craft great software.</strong>&#160; Now certainly we all know people who have been successful without a traditional education, in fact you’re reading the blog of one right now.&#160; And I will be the first to tell anyone leaving High School that a four year degree is your most certain path to success in software development.&#160; But for some, that ship has sailed.</p>  <p>For some, the reality of life is such that leaving work is beyond their reach because of the need to support themselves.&#160; One such person as this is Christopher Jackson, a good friend of mine that has exceptional analytic skills but who also finds himself functionally unemployed currently, having lost his last job to a downsize from the economy, he now acts as a substitute teacher in the <a href="http://www.fwisd.org/hcm/Pages/position_sub.aspx">Fort Worth Independent School District</a> for the incredible sum of <a href="http://www.pegasusnews.com/news/2007/jul/19/fort-worth-isd-accepting-applications-substitute-t/?refscroll=609">$73 dollars per day</a>.&#160; Compare that to the average salary for an entry level developer, approximately $56K/year, and I believe you will agree that cultivating his interest into a marketable skill set should have an impact on his life.&#160; Chris has always had an interest in writing software, but it is hard to find time to go back to school while working.</p>  <p>As such, Chris and I have come to arrangement, one that is an experiment for me but which I firmly believe in.&#160; Effective today, January 9th 2011, Chris has begun an unpaid internship with my company TimRayburn.net LLC which puts on <a href="http://www.dallastechfest.com">Dallas TechFest</a> and other projects of mine.&#160; During the internship, he will be working with me to increase his basic skills in development, and learn how to craft software from the ground up.&#160; Initially, he will be working on assignments with little real-world application, but eventually he will be assisting me on actual projects that deliver real world value.&#160; As I’m sure some will be curious on how I have structured this plan, I will lay out at a high level what is involved:</p>  <ul>   <li>A commitment to dedicate time to the effort.&#160; Chris will be spending time with my at least three days a week for multiple hours. </li>    <li>A commitment from his spouse to support him in this effort.&#160; Chris is newly married, and his spouse needs to be on board if he is to have the support he will need at home. </li>    <li>A time boxed commitment, for us initially of six months.&#160; This will allow Chris to commit, while also knowing that it has an end point, and that if he chooses to continue than changes can occur at that time. </li>    <li>A penalty for not meeting the commitment.&#160; The details of which will not be public, but which are notable enough to impact his life should he decide to walk away from the commitment. </li>    <li>A reasonable third party arbiter, trusted by both myself and Chris who will be able to settle any disagreements around the penalty should that need arise.&#160; My wife Kate will be serving that role, which for Chris and I who have been friends for over 15 years is agreeable. </li> </ul>  <p>I do not know how this will go, but I am certain it will generate blog posts as I learn while I teach.&#160; Any suggestions?</p> <!-- BEGIN SALARY GRAPH --><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://www.simplyhired.com/c/salary-common/styles/salary-graph-external.css" media="screen,print" />  <div class="SH_salary_graph">   <div class="SH_blue_box">     <div class="SH_bluetop">&#160;</div>      <div class="SH_blue_box_container">       <h3>Average Entry Level Developer Salaries in Arlington, TX</h3>        <table class="SH_bar_graph" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><colgroup><col class="SH_col_a1" /><col class="SH_col_a2" /><col class="SH_col_sep" /><col class="SH_col_b" /><col class="SH_col_c" /><col class="SH_col_d" /></colgroup><tfoot>           <tr>             <td class="SH_bar_graph_footer" colspan="2">In USD as of Jan 9, 2011</td>              <td></td>              <td colspan="3">               <table class="SH_salary_percent" width="100%"><tbody>                   <tr class="SH_salary_footer">                     <td><span>25k</span></td>                      <td><span>50k</span></td>                      <td><span>75k</span></td>                   </tr>                 </tbody></table>             </td>           </tr>         </tfoot><tbody>           <tr>             <td class="SH_salary_job_title">               <h4><a class="SH_job_title" href="http://www.simplyhired.com/a/jobs/list/q-entry+level+developer/l-arlington%2c+tx">entry level developer</a></h4>             </td>              <td class="SH_salary_amount"><span class="SH_salary">$56,000</span></td>              <td></td>              <td class="SH_salary_percent" colspan="3" align="left">               <div style="width: 75%" class="SH_bar"></div>             </td>           </tr>         </tbody></table>     </div> <!-- SH_blue_box_container -->      <div class="SH_bluebottom">&#160;</div>   </div> <!-- SH_blue_box --></div> <!-- SH_salary_graph -->  <div class="SH_salary_graph_footer">Find <a href="http://www.simplyhired.com/">Jobs</a> &amp;

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been invited to speak tonight at the <a href="http://sug.dotnetprogramming.com/">Spokane .NET Users Group</a> and I’ll be talking about Heresy with MongoDB.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>In the back of most developers minds, lingering in their subconscious and waiting to pounce when they least expect it is the nagging concept that not every system in the world is an ideal fit for the structured life of a relational database. Join Microsoft MVP, Tim Rayburn as he reviews MongoDB, a document database, its concepts, ideas and the drivers available to the .NET developer for using this project. Come learn how you may never again have to separate OrderLines from Orders just to make a database happy – and similar approaches used by the likes of Amazon and Google (just to name a few).</p></blockquote>
