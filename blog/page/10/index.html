  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig">Chris Koenig</a>, our Local Developer Evangelist has a big event coming up, here are some details:</p> <p><a href="http://timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/VisualStudio2008InstallFest_80BD/Visual%20Studio%202008%20Pro%20Logo_2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 10px; border-right-width: 0px" height="51" alt="Visual Studio 2008 Pro Logo" src="http://timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/VisualStudio2008InstallFest_80BD/Visual%20Studio%202008%20Pro%20Logo_thumb.png" width="240" align="left" border="0"></a> </p> <p>To celebrate the RTM of Visual Studio 2008, Microsoft is teaming up with some of the local area User Groups to throw a set of Holiday Party InstallFests.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got 3 of them scheduled for South Central District:<ul> <li>Dec 3 – Tulsa (<a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032360634&amp;Culture=en-US">Registration Link</a>) with the Tulsa Developers User Group<li>Dec 5 – Dallas (<a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032360642&amp;Culture=en-US">Registration Link</a>) with the North Dallas .NET User Group<li>Dec 13 – Houston (<a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032360649&amp;Culture=en-US">Registration Link</a>) with the Houston .NET User Group </li></ul> <p>These holiday parties will feature food, drink, fun - including several Xbox 360s in HD with some of the latest games, fellowship and a chance to install the RTM bits of Visual Studio 2008 along with your friends! In fact, <strong>EVERYONE THAT REGISTERS FOR AND ATTENDS THE EVENT IN PERSON WILL RECEIVE A FREE COPY OF VISUAL STUDIO 2008 PROFESSIONAL IN THE MAIL ONCE IT&#8217;S AVAILABLE!</strong>&nbsp; As an added bonus - if you install Visual Studio 2008 on your computer during the event, we&#8217;ll give you a free Visual Studio T-Shirt! So - no sneaky register-for-the-event-and-then-not-show-up action - you must be present to win :-)<p>Since we&#8217;re giving away free product, we&#8217;ve had to put a cap on registrations - so register now and make sure you attend to get your free copy of Visual Studio 2008 Professional.&nbsp; If registrations are full, the waitlist should be enabled, so get on it.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t make it on the registration or waitlist list, don&#8217;t fret - walk-ins are totally welcome, and we&#8217;d love to have you join us at the party!&nbsp; If there is any product left over after all the registered and wait-listed folks get theirs, you&#8217;ll be next in line to get one :-)</p> <p><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong> <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; What version of Visual Studio will I get, and how will the free version upgrade work? <br>A:</strong>&nbsp; You will be installing a copy of Visual Studio 2008 Professional Trial Edition at the event.&nbsp; This is a specially created 90-day evaluation of VS08Pro - it is NOT the same thing that is available today from Microsoft Downloads.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you receive your free copy of Visual Studio 2008 in the mail, you will be able to enter the product key from the packaging into VS08 and &#8220;unlock&#8221; it.&nbsp; The unlocking process will only work for the PRO trial edition that you get at the InstallFest - the version from Microsoft Downloads or MSDN will NOT be unlockable and will require an uninstall/re-install to get the proper version installed. <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t Visual Studio 2008 RTM already publicly available?&nbsp; Why do I need to come to this party? <br>A:</strong>&nbsp; Several reasons - first, the opportunity to have some fun over the holidays with your local user groups!&nbsp; Second, we are giving away FREE copies of Visual Studio 2008 Professional to registered attendees in the mail following the product launch.&nbsp; <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; Do I have to bring my laptop to the event? <br>A: </strong> No, you don&#8217;t. But - if you install the bits at the party, we&#8217;ll give you a free T-shirt <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; What if I don&#8217;t have a laptop - can I bring my Desktop?&nbsp; Will there be room/power? <br>A:</strong>&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Please do - we&#8217;re looking for volunteers to bring their monitors + keyboards + mice to the event so that not everyone else needs to.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re interested in helping us this way, please let me know. <p><strong>Q: Can I bring a friend? <br>A:</strong>&nbsp; Absolutely!&nbsp; Bring 2!&nbsp; Just remember that you have to be registered, or on the wait list, for a chance to win free product. <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; Does this InstallFest party cost anything to attend? <br>A: </strong> Nope - it&#8217;s absolutely FREE to all attendees! <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; Does this replace the normal .NET User Group meeting in my city? <br>A:</strong>&nbsp; Yes - there aren&#8217;t any plans to have additional meetings, but there will be plenty of .NET conversations going on around the party, I&#8217;m sure :-) <p><strong>Q: I can&#8217;t go to this event - can I still get a free copy of Visual Studio 2008 somewhere else? <br>A:</strong> There are several other events coming up that will give you additional chances at getting free product including the next round of <a href="http://www.devcares.com">DevCares</a> events, the &#8220;official&#8221; product launch events starting at the end of February, and some post-release Community Launch events starting in March (more on that in a future post).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About 30 days ago I began the process of installing a Windows Home Server in my house.&nbsp; After what is now referred to as the &#8220;Great Hard Drive Crash of April 2007&#8221; by my wife, it was clear to me that I needed to address the data recovery/disaster recovery plan for my house a little bit more in depth, a Home Server was my second step, the first was Mozy but that&#8217;s another post.</p> <p><a href="http://timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsHomeServer_18A9/Windows%20Home%20Server.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" alt="Windows Home Server" src="http://timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsHomeServer_18A9/Windows%20Home%20Server_thumb.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a> </p> <p>The &#8220;Windows Home Server&#8221; operating system is currently only available OEM to System Builders or via online resellers which resell such OEM products.&nbsp; Creating a Home Server was both no problem what so ever, and obviously System Builder material at the same time.&nbsp; The OS install reboots multiple times, identifies itself as Windows Small Business Server 2003 for portions of it, and otherwise is not &#8220;polished&#8221; for retail delivery.</p> <p>On the other hand, the experience once it is installed is fantastic.&nbsp; This software has many useful features, but the big one for us was the dynamic storage system.&nbsp; You can create a virtual storage system from many smaller drives which have no restrictions on them, they can be any size, speed, interface, etc you happen to have.</p> <p>In my case the first portion of storage was the remainder of my boot drive, which the system automatically partitioned and handed over the largest segment of (all but 30gb) to storage.&nbsp; Then I added 2 USB hard drives.&nbsp; A few weeks later, after some traveling, I added another drive from a system I was no longer using bringing the total storage to 0.98 TB, not bad.&nbsp; Well during the recent Black Friday sales here in the US I picked up a new 1TB My Book from Western Digital, installed that and brought the server to 1.98 TB.</p> <p>It was this upgrade that made me write this post.&nbsp; I was anxious, I did the upgrade in the middle of the night while several people in my house were watching videos from the Home Server.&nbsp; I had to add a USB hub, so I had to unplug one of the drives in the array.&nbsp; Instantly every box on the network was notified of a drive failure on the Home Server, but despite that there was no interruption of either video stream that was running.&nbsp; I then plugged in the drives, added the additional storage, and started pulling a video file myself to take the load to 3 simultaneous video feeds.&nbsp; There was a touch of slowness during the next 5 minutes as the server sought to balance the storage, but nothing horrible.&nbsp; My house has 4 laptops, 3 desktops and a the home server currently and I must say that it handles this admirably.</p> <p>My only gripe?&nbsp; They need a 64 bit version of the Home Server client software.&nbsp; I&#8217;m aware of the hacks to get this installed, but it doesn&#8217;t get the backups running and that is key.</p>
