  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starting Monday morning I will be starting a new project for a client of my employer <a href="http://improvingenterprises.com/">Improving Enterprises</a>.&#160; I’ve spent a good deal of time talking with my new teammates about what technologies we will be using for the project, and I thought that work might be of interest to others, so here are some of the highlights.</p>  <h2>Technology Stack : VS2010, .NET 4, C#</h2>  <p>The first thing that was decided, during the initial scoping phase of the project, was that this project was a nearly ideal candidate for Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.0.&#160; How did we come to that decision?&#160; The desired architecture for the project is such that certain features of WCF 4.0 and Entity Framework 4.0 would help with the implementation, and the timeline of the project is such that we have a no concerns over the current lack of the a “Go Live” license.&#160; For language it was decided we will primarily be working in C#. With that decided, we get to the far more interesting pieces.</p>  <h2>Inversion of Control : StructureMap</h2>  <p>Obviously we are going to need an IoC container for the project, and we have settled on <a href="http://structuremap.sourceforge.net">StructureMap</a> for that.&#160; The competition in this regard was <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html">Castle Windsor</a> as <a href="http://improvingenterprises.com/">Improving</a> has the benefit of employing Craig Neuwirt, we knew we had an expert.&#160; The final decision to go with <a href="http://structuremap.sourceforge.net">StructureMap</a> instead hinged on two related things, complexity and learning curve.&#160; While we were quite certain we could pick up Castle quickly enough (2 of the 3 did not know it already), we were not as certain how easy it would be for those who follow us.&#160; <a href="http://structuremap.sourceforge.net">StructureMap</a> had a single well defined scope (IoC), versus the larger bite that the Castle Project would be for those who follow.&#160; We recognize we could have <strong>just</strong> done Windsor, but we found no compelling reasons to do that versus <a href="http://structuremap.sourceforge.net">StructureMap</a>.</p>  <p>As noted, we will be doing a good bit of WCF 4.0 on this project, so it naturally followed we would need to integrated StructureMap into the channel stack to let it handle the creation of our service instances.&#160; <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2008/07/29/integrating-structuremap-with-wcf.aspx">Jimmy Bogard has an excellent post</a> on this subject, and we followed that guidance closely, though we updated the StructureMapServiceHostFactory to use ObjectFactory.Initialize as was recommended by the excellent ObsoleteAttribute usage in the latest StructureMap.</p>  <h2>Source Control : GIT</h2>  <p>Even within a group of people as passionate about creating great technology as we have at Improving, there are certain debates that deeply divide us.&#160; Source Control is definitely one of them.&#160; We have a certain segment of the company that are passionate advocates for <a href="http://www.teamsystemlive.com/">Team System</a>, obviously including <a href="http://techtea.typepad.com/teamsystem/">Chris Tullier</a> our resident Team System MVP.&#160; But there are others who are passionate believers in Subversion.&#160; Still others are not happy with either of those options, and still seek the “better mouse trap” for Source Control.&#160; We discussed the pros and cons of various solutions and decided in the end to try GIT, because of its distributed model, and see how we liked it in comparison to the others.&#160; It is an experiment, and we shall see.</p>  <h2>Logging : log4net</h2>  <p>Really, is there another option?&#160; The definitive logging library for .NET, it does what it needs to and does not bring along any additional baggage.&#160; As we are also using StructureMap, we found <a href="http://aspzone.com/tech/structuremap-ninject-log4net/">this blog post by John Rudolf Lewis</a> helpful in discussing how to inject <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/index.html">log4net</a> using StructureMap (or Ninject) without losing fidelity in the logs.</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  <p>So there are a few of our technology decisions, things I’ll be learning on in the coming months more and more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">Some time ago I made a post about using external file dependencies with NUnit. That post was about using a class called TestFile, which implemented IDisposable, to temporarily store files to disk, and then clean them up afterwards. While learning my way around the BizTalk unit testing capabilities in BizTalk 2009, I realized that this class could use some minor initial modifications to make life easier. To that end, I present to you that updated class. The most important new feature is the ability to support having it generate the file name as a temp file, and the ability to load resources from any Assembly in the AppDomain.   <pre class="brush: csharp;">public class TestFile : IDisposable
{
    private bool _disposedValue = false;
    private string _resourceName;
    private string _fileName;

    public TestFile(string resourceName) : this(null, resourceName) { }

    public TestFile(string fileName, string resourceName)
    {
        if (fileName == null)
        {
            this.FileName = Path.GetTempFileName();
            File.Delete(this.FileName);
        }
        else 
            this.FileName = fileName;

        using (Stream s = LoadResourceFromAppDomain(resourceName))
        using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(s))
        using (StreamWriter sw = File.CreateText(this.FileName))
        {
            sw.Write(sr.ReadToEnd());
            sw.Flush();
        }
    }

    private Stream LoadResourceFromAppDomain(string resourceName)
    {
        Assembly[] appDomainAssemblies = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies();
        Stream outStream = null;

        foreach (var lAssem in appDomainAssemblies)
        {
            outStream = lAssem.GetManifestResourceStream(resourceName);
            if (outStream != null) return outStream;
        }

        throw new Exception(string.Format(&quot;Unable to find resource stream {0}&quot;,resourceName));
    }

    public string FileName
    {
        get { return _fileName; }
        set
        {
            _fileName = value;
        }
    }
    

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!this._disposedValue)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                if (File.Exists(_fileName))
                {
                    File.Delete(_fileName);
                }
            }
        }
        this._disposedValue = true;
    }

    #region IDisposable Members

    public void Dispose()
    {
        // Do not change this code.Put cleanup code in Dispose(bool disposing) above.
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    #endregion

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m thrilled to announce that BizTalk Server 2009 has become available on MSDN, as of last Saturday.</p>  <p>The 2009 release includes many cool things, but I’d like to highlight the unit testing capabilities that have been added to the product.&#160; With this release, there is now support for unit testing of Maps, Schemas and Pipelines.&#160; While not perfect, these features are a great initial down payment on bringing BizTalk development in line with state of the art practices in other development areas.&#160; I’m so thrilled that these features have been added that I will be doing a post series over the next several weeks on reducing the friction in unit testing these features, and you can look forward to the first installment shortly.</p>
