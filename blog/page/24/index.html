  <div class="entry-content"><P><A href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/10/liabilities_and.html">Bruce Schneier has written an editorial on his blog and for Wired</A> which takes issue with the position put out by a former White House technology adviser that developers should be held personally responsible for security problems in the code they write.&nbsp; Bruce feels that this is not wise at all &#8230; as a developer, I completely disagree.</P><P>Bruce&#8217;s analysis of the market forces involved in ensuring that security improves is dead on, which means for the proposal of developer liability to work means that developers must have a greater stake in the marketability of the code they write.&nbsp; As a consultant I can say I welcome the idea, and so should any full-time corporate developer.&nbsp; Personal liability would guarantee that my rates would rise considerably to cover that risk, and that I would insist that if I am personally liable for code that I produce then I will keep the right to use that code on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; It would shake up programming as we know it, forcing businesses to realize that the developers on a project could not be treated as mere resources but would be far closer akin to partners in a project.</P><P>Now, it would have some downsides.&nbsp; Programming is already incredibly hard to get started in, especially if you come into the industry from a non-traditional vector (i.e. not from College).&nbsp; Personal liability would make new programmers yet more of risk and you may very well see some talented young minds who made a mistake go down in flames.&nbsp; It would also force business types to change the entire compensation model for programmers in radical ways.</P><P>Is this likely to happen? Of course not!&nbsp; Bruce is absolutely correct about the &#8220;right&#8221; way for government to address this problem.&nbsp; But as for me and my pocketbook, I wouldn&#8217;t mind if the government tried to something like this proposal.</P><P>&nbsp;</P>

  <div class="entry-content"><P>I&#8217;ve had a chance recently to speak with people about Code Generation and problems they perceived using Visual Studio 2003.&nbsp; Everyone is quick to point out that <STRONG>partial</STRONG> classes will solve alot of the problems with Code Generation when we have Visual Studio 2005, but they find it tedious or difficult to extend classes they have generated and then late regenerate them in Visual Studio 2003.&nbsp; Still, there are several perfectly good options for this in VS03.</P><OL><LI>Generate <STRONG>abstract</STRONG> classes which you then inherit from.&nbsp; Particularly useful for data access layers, this would produce an Abstract<EM>TableName </EM>and then a simply 3 line <EM>TableName</EM> class. For example, if your table was named Customer and you were writing in VB, you would have AbstractCustomer.vb which looks like:<BR><BR><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&#8216;This is a class generated by your favorite Code Generation utility<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&#8216;such as CodeSmith (www.codesmithtools.com)<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Public</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"> <SPAN style="COLOR: blue">MustInherit</SPAN> <SPAN style="COLOR: blue">Class</SPAN> AbstractCustomers<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: green">&#8216;Generated properties and code go here&#8230;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></SPAN></P><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">End</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"> <SPAN style="COLOR: blue">Class<BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3>And a Customer.vb file which you did not generate which started containing only:<BR></P><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Public</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"> <SPAN style="COLOR: blue">Class</SPAN> Customers<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: blue">Inherits</SPAN> AbstractCustomers<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">End</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"> <SPAN style="COLOR: blue">Class</SPAN></SPAN></P></FONT></SPAN></SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"><SPAN style="COLOR: blue"><FONT color=#000000><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"><SPAN style="COLOR: blue"><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3>Another valid option is to use preservation regions, a feature in my favorite code generation utility CodeSmith.&nbsp; This allows you to create a region which will be left, untouched, after you regenerate the file</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P></FONT></SPAN></SPAN></LI></OL><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"><SPAN style="COLOR: blue"><FONT color=#000000><P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"><SPAN style="COLOR: blue"><FONT face="Times New Roman" color=#000000 size=3>Certainly we will have an easier time once we have partial classes, but as it will take time for shops to upgrade, you can call these techniques when you have to generate code and then extend upon the generation.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>

  <div class="entry-content"><P>We&#8217;ve recently had a problem at <A href="http://www.ghnonline.com">my employer</A> where we were performing a very large number of database retrievals in a class called from a BizTalk Orchestration.&nbsp; The class was already performing checks to ensure it only went after a particular piece of data once, but performance was still lacking compared to the desired results.&nbsp; What was needed was to look for &#8220;economy of scale&#8221; solutions to this problem, because we were likely to be calling this Orchestration on multiple threads at once almost all day.</P><P>The solution?&nbsp; A Singleton Pattern caching mechanism so that multiple threads would retrieve the rows in question only once and then store it in memory for a short period (the data was over a very non-dynamic nature).&nbsp; The solution hinges on a very important thing for .NET developers to remember about BizTalk Server :<STRONG> BizTalk Server 2004 is itself a .NET application</STRONG>!&nbsp; This means that the service which runs all of the Orchestrations creates a .NET AppDomain when it starts and a static structure (like a Singleton) will be reachable by any threads started within the AppDomain.&nbsp; Once a single thread had caused the cache to contain a particular row of data, all other threads would be able to work from the copy in memory.&nbsp; We saw radical increases in performance from this relatively simple change.</P><P><STRONG>Disclaimer</STRONG> : Be certain to thread-safe your Singleton, or you will throw your entire BizTalk Server into a race condition very quickly.</P>

  <div class="entry-content"><P>Today did not start as a good day.&nbsp; After considerable time in development (months), a major component of our project was put under load-test yesterday and left to run overnight.</P><P>The &#8220;load&#8221; in this case was a trivial load, a fraction of our daily business at the current time.&nbsp; That trivial amount of load took 11 hours to process, which I was informed at 8:30 AM this morning.&nbsp; I was not a happy architect.&nbsp; So with thousands of lines of code to consider, my first step was a manual quick-scan looking for blatant problems.&nbsp; In retrospect, I shouldn&#8217;t have done this.&nbsp; It yielded some results, but missed the mark on the big issue (even if the DB access inside the component did have considerable problems).</P><P>So I went off in search of a profiling tool, something that could help me isolate the problem.&nbsp; Google resulted&nbsp;a top hit on <A href="http://nprof.sourceforge.net/Site/SiteHomeNews.html">NProf</A>, a link from <A href="http://www.larkware.com">Larkware</A> by Mike Gunderloy who I read religously where he had <A href="http://www.larkware.com/Articles/FreeNETProfiler.html">reviewed this tool</A>.&nbsp; I set it to work on a simple executable I wrote to create an isolated test of this component (yes, I had a Unit Test Library, no I didn&#8217;t want to spend the time to figure out how to make it work with NUnit just then).&nbsp; The offending method popped up in the results very nicely, and has been slated for immediate refactoring tommorow.</P><P>Of particular note is that this profiler does not stop at calls to your code, but traces the entire framework during your application run.&nbsp; As such I know not only which method of mine is offending, but which of the methods it calls offends the most, etc, etc, etc.</P><P>As a side note, that code calls the String.get_Chars(int32) some 238 MILLION times in the course of it&#8217;s 5 minute run.&nbsp; And that only accounted for 2.54 percent of the total time.</P>
