  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was reading Scott Hanselman&#8217;s blog today and ran across <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a8bbf0a5-188e-429f-8e37-a8813b460780">this post</a> which is actually his refferal to the site for <a href="http://www.cauldwell.net/patrick/blog/PermaLink,guid,e9a1451b-108c-4da7-8be9-2b6c2316f7b1.aspx">this post</a> from Patrick Cauldwell&#8217;s blog.  Both are discussing how to use external files as part of your Unit Testing in NUnit.</p><p>As pointed out by Patrick, using paths to reach such files is problematic as the file&#8217;s location may shift from your box to a build box, etc.  So the perfectly elegant solution that has been devised by Patrick is to create such files as Embedded Resources in your testing project.  You can then access that file as a stream, and write it out to a known position (such as a temp directory) for your tests to use.</p><p>Pretty slick &#8230; need to write the VB &#8216;conversion&#8217; here shortly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alright, my blog has languished without a clear purpose for some time now, being a mix of various things which I am interested in.  So rather than let it continue to languish, I&#8217;ve decided to revamp the blog and focus it on matters technical.  As of today it will focus primarily on the technologies which I work with every day : BizTalk Server, VB.NET, C# and the HIPAA Accelerator for BizTalk.</p><p>I will also be increasing the frequency with which I blog, and will be soon be bringing up some articles about various topics.  A few topics include :</p><ul><li>Realities of BizTalk Server in an EDI World</li><li>EDI Functoids</li><li>COM+ in a .NET world</li></ul><p>I hope that those few of you which do read this blog will find the technical turn of the blog a worthy one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That is the question.</p><p>I&#8217;m working on the architecture for my company&#8217;s Next Generation platform (code name yet to be decided).  We&#8217;ve already decided on a handful of important things such as:</p><ul><li>Visual Basic.NET for all User Interfaces</li><li>C# for everything else.</li><li>Test Driven Development for at least the non-UI portions of the site.</li><li>Alot of Extreme Programming concepts, but scaled back for a small shop.</li></ul><p>Now, coming from a Visual Basic background, and having done ALOT of web development, I love COM+.  I love the transactionality, I love visibility on components, etc.  I like Queued Components for an easy level of asychronous processing.</p><p>But COM+ is still COM.  I realize that this will require InterOp, etc, but it seems to me that pure Managed Code lacks the ease of development that COM+ provides for certain aspects.  For instance, to do a “Queued Component” without using COM+ I&#8217;m going to have to write my own serialization routines, I&#8217;m going to have to write my own listener service, etc.  Is this really worth not having to deal with InterOp?  Thoughts?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had a chance this week to go check out a talk by David Chappell held at the Las Colinas office of Microsoft.  The subject of the day was BizTalk Server 2004.</p><p>I&#8217;ve worked with BizTalk Server since before it was publicly available.  While working for HealthAxis I was on a team of two developers who were working with an Alpha version of BizTalk Server (before they even settled on the names ports and channels).  I&#8217;ve since worked with BizTalk Server 2000, and 2002.  I&#8217;m hard to impress when it comes to BTS, they&#8217;ve made lots of promises in the past, and all have fallen short.  That said, all I can say about BizTalk Server 2004 is &#8230; <strong>WOW!</strong></p><p>They seem to have actually gotten Orchestrations to the point where I won&#8217;t cry every time I have to use them.  The complete integration with Visual Studio is very nice, no more swapping between fifty different tools.  The EDI solutions are better, and their partnership with COVAST means that if you&#8217;re willing to lay out the dough, you can make BizTalk a <strong>real</strong> EDI solution.</p><p>The speakers as a whole were ok, David Chappell was the best, though a close runner up was the ever animated Terry Gore.  Terry&#8217;s presentation also proved you not only could do stuff with BizTalk, but you could do it fast.  His presentation created Message definitions from scratch, wrote an orchestraion to handle some logic and conditionally return 1 of 2 documents. The he re-wrote the orchestration (from scratch!) to use the Business Rules Engine, and demonstrated how to setup rules in the BRE.  Then he published that orchestration as a Web Service, used InfoPath to create a form to submit to that Web Service, and finally published the Infopath form to Windows Sharepoint Services forms Library.  All in an hour and a half.  Impressive, and I feel confident I could repeat that process, though it might take me 2 hours.</p><p>Anyway, comes the end of the long day of training and the infamous drawings.  Top prize was an XBox &#8230; and I won it!  Very cool, of course now I need to get a Wireless-G connector for it, and another copy of HALO.  HALO2 is November 9th, according to my local GameStop, and I can&#8217;t wait.</p>
