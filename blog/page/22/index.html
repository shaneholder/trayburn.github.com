  <div class="entry-content"><p>Show of hands, who has opened up a map created by someone else and been filled with dread at the concept of modifying the map, even for something relatively simply.&nbsp; I&#8217;m willing to bet the answer is nearly everyone who has ever done mapping.&nbsp; It usually starts when you open a map and see something like this:</p> <p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="556" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/MappingFundamentalsOrganizationistheKey_B5B3/OrganizationIsTheKey-FunctiodNightmare%5B9%5D.png" width="703" border="0"> </p> <p><em>[Yes, that is from a real client.&nbsp; No, I won&#8217;t say who.]</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As if that alone wasn&#8217;t enough to make one cry, layouts like that lead to property dialog boxes like this:</p> <p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="474" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/MappingFundamentalsOrganizationistheKey_B5B3/OrganizationIsTheKey-PropertyBox%5B6%5D.png" width="402" border="0"> </p> <p>So to help you avoid leaving wonderful presents like these for someone else who follows you onto your projects, I&#8217;d like to suggest the following guidelines to follow when you are working with the Mapper.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Organize on Pages</strong> - The Mapper will allow you to create an infinite number of pages on which to organize your maps.&nbsp; You should use this to great advantage.&nbsp; Find a system of organization that works for you and stick with it.&nbsp; The two most common systems are a &#8220;destination structure&#8221; approach where a page is used to organize the contents of a particular element on the destination schema and the &#8220;mapping concepts&#8221; approach pages tend to get names like &#8220;Direct Links&#8221; and &#8220;Looping&#8221; to indicate that type of mapping that is occuring on that page.&nbsp; Personally I like to mix the two depending on the problem in front of me.</li> <li><strong>Label your Links</strong> - If you select a link (a line) in the mapper and look at the Properties window you will see that it has a property named &#8220;Label&#8221;.&nbsp; This is the most under used property in all of BizTalk.&nbsp; If you label a link (and a label can be any string value) then when you open the properties dialog box of your next functoid you will see the label next to the icon, rather than the above property box you&#8217;ll end up with something like this:</li></ol> <p><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="474" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/MappingFundamentalsOrganizationistheKey_B5B3/OrganizationIsTheKey-ProperPropertyBox%5B6%5D.png" width="402" border="0"></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This TLA (Three Letter Acronym)&nbsp;littered post is about how to add PDB&nbsp;(Program DataBase)&nbsp;files to the GAC (Global Assembly Cache).&nbsp; </p> <p>Today my current client had the need to get the true source of an exception.&nbsp; They had a catch statement which logged the exception (via log4net) to a file, but the location in question was a poorly designed component with hundreds of lines of code all wrapped within a very large Try-Catch which logged errors.&nbsp; The error was likewise unhelpful as to the source because it was an array out of bounds exception, and this code did alot of string array manipulation.&nbsp; The solution was clear to me, we needed to load the PDB files onto the server so that when an exception was thrown there would be line number information to go with it.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/HowtoputPDBsintheGAC_12BCE/GACDirectories%5B5%5D.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="131" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/HowtoputPDBsintheGAC_12BCE/GACDirectories_thumb%5B3%5D.png" width="240" align="right" border="0"></a></p> <p>The problem?&nbsp; The assembly was being called by BizTalk Server and as such it was strongly named and in the GAC.</p> <p>The solution?&nbsp; Add the PDB files to the GAC, of course.</p> <p>&nbsp;The Global Assembly Cache which is&nbsp;located at %WINDIR%\assembly (&#8220;c:\windows\assembly&#8221; on most boxes) is in fact organized into many different directories all of which exist under %WINDIR%\assembly but which by default are hidden from view by Explorer.&nbsp; Fortunately, the command prompt does not suffer the same problems.&nbsp; If you open a command prompt and &#8220;cd %windir%\assembly&#8221; and do&nbsp;a &#8220;dir&#8221; you will see several directories as you can see in the first image.</p> <p><a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/HowtoputPDBsintheGAC_12BCE/AssemblyDirectories%5B4%5D.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 5px; border-right-width: 0px" height="131" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/HowtoputPDBsintheGAC_12BCE/AssemblyDirectories_thumb%5B2%5D.png" width="240" align="left" border="0"></a> If you change directory to &#8220;GAC&#8221; you will see a directory for every single assembly in the GAC.&nbsp; From here, cd to the directory for the assembly you want, in my example nunit.framework, and you will see another interesting set of directories.&nbsp; Here you will see one directory for every combination of version number and public key in the GAC.&nbsp; You need to know what version you are working with, and the public key for that.&nbsp; cd into that directory and you will find a copy of your assembly.&nbsp; Now all you have to do is copy your PDB file to this location and your next exception should contain line numbers for the offending code.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since the work to generate line numbers is only done when an exception is being thrown there is little to no reason not to include the PDB files in all your production deployments to the GAC.&nbsp; Yes, generating them takes time, but if you&#8217;re throwing an exception this shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.&nbsp; After all, you are treating exceptions as exceptional, right?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><P>I was recently introduced to <A href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</A> by Ed Kisinger of <A href="http://www.EdSquared.com">EdSquared.com</A> and absolutely love the project.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve previously used to Logging Application Block inside Enterprise Manager for my logging, and would again if I was using the rest of EntLib, but log4net fills the wonderful point where you may not want to take on all of EntLib and still have excellent logging.</P><P>log4net abstracts the actually logging on messages from the location that a log will be stored.&nbsp; As such it is easy to change from file logging, to UDP network logging to Database logging, all without touching the code which actually logs.&nbsp; Fantastic idea!&nbsp; The Appender model, as they call this, includes many excellent Appenders right out of the box.</P><P>In particular, I wanted to use to AdoNetAppender to log my messages to a database.&nbsp; Easy enough, the simple example included in the AdoNetAppender documentation logs the most basic of information.&nbsp; But as you dig deeper into what information log4net <STRONG>can</STRONG> store, you begin to realize how oversimplified this structure really is.</P><P>It would be a reasonable thing to say that I can sometimes be a bit of a perfectionist.&nbsp; As such I spent this morning creating a database structure capable of holding all of the log4net information, properly normalized to the third normal form.&nbsp; If you would like to be able to store any information available from log4net when logging to a database, then feel free to take this structure and adapt it to your needs.</P><P>The only personalized piece of this database at the moment is the inclusion of a column for storing a property called InstanceId.&nbsp; As I work with BizTalk on a regular basis, and love <A href="http://www.traceofthought.com/">Scott Colestock&#8217;s BizTalk Deployment Framework</A>, I included a column for the Orchestration instance id which his <A href="http://www.traceofthought.net/misc/BT2006DeployWithNAntSample_3.0.zip">Serializable log4net extension</A> includes.</P><P><A href="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/log4netDatabase.zip">Download Version 1.0 of log4net Database</A></P>

  <div class="entry-content"><IMG height=79 alt=Sogeti align="right" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/Sogeti_logo.jpg" width=359 border=0>So a fairly major change has happened in the last few weeks which I let pass without commenting here. A week ago I started a new position as a Principal Consultant with Sogeti USA. It&#8217;s been a good several years making it on my own as a consultant working with my wife&#8217;s company Tech-Knights, but it was time for a change. Sogeti is focused on a regional practice, which is really what I was looking for, but with global reach. My first assignment is with HealthMarkets, formerly UICI, which is great because I used to work for their sister company InsurData before it merged with HealthAxis. It&#8217;s fun to see some of the same faces I used to work with in &#8216;99-&#8216;00.<BR><BR>After a week getting settled and helping with some small problems, I&#8217;m off for a week on vacation to visit Virginia and then go down to Charolette, North Carolina to attend the wedding of my brother-in-law Chad. It&#8217;s been a while since I could take a vacation so it&#8217;s nice to get away and clear my head.
