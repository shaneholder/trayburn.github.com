If someone is not necessary for this phase of a project, then they shouldn&#8217;t be on the team until they are needed.&nbsp; Hording talented resources makes them bored.&nbsp; Bored talented people get employed by your competitors.</FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Cut Down Bureacracy<BR></STRONG>Managers should exist to cut through red-tape, not create it.&nbsp; If your job is to manage development resources you should spend most of your time each day allowing them to be creative and solve problems.&nbsp; Your team should feel comfortable calling you with the smallest concerns and knowing you will get things done in a timely manner.&nbsp; Your a member of the team to.</FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Be Honest And Keep Your Promises<BR></STRONG>Try to straight forward in all your communications.&nbsp; If there is change coming, tell people as soon as you can.&nbsp;
