    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent alot of time tonight trying to find an elegant solution to the problem of detecting the light or dark theme from Windows Phone 7 and changing images based on those options.  I was people that were doing a ToString in the Foreground Brush, or writing custom methods for every image in their code-behind, and all of that felt  ... dirty.  Finally I <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7198046/how-to-swap-images-based-on-the-current-theme-wp7">came across this solution on StackOverflow</a> which is not the "accepted" answer, but is the highest voted answer.  It was good enough to get me to post the answer here as well, so I can remember it, and hopefully some of you who might be working to hard can find a more elegant solution.</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `Py_IsInitialized' for RubyPython::Python:Module</p>
