    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent alot of time tonight trying to find an elegant solution to the problem of detecting the light or dark theme from Windows Phone 7 and changing images based on those options.  I was people that were doing a ToString in the Foreground Brush, or writing custom methods for every image in their code-behind, and all of that felt  ... dirty.  Finally I <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7198046/how-to-swap-images-based-on-the-current-theme-wp7">came across this solution on StackOverflow</a> which is not the "accepted" answer, but is the highest voted answer.  It was good enough to get me to post the answer here as well, so I can remember it, and hopefully some of you who might be working to hard can find a more elegant solution.</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `Py_IsInitialized' for RubyPython::Python:Module</p>

I've recently started developing for Windows Phone 7 because my apprentices have been very interested in the mobile space.  My first application is a utility used by players in <a href="http://swtor.com">Star Wars : The Old Republic</a> called <a href="http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=9b2a529d-8b02-4db7-a954-71677a50268b">Pylon Solver</a>.  The application is a solver for the Ancient Pylons puzzle in Eternity Vault.  But unlike so many of the apps out there, this one addresses a common problem, it is color-blind friendly.  Most of the solvers out there use just the colors, not the shapes, from the game.  This app uses both to provide a quick easy interface to solving the puzzle.  I'd appreciate any <a href="http://swtor.com">SWTOR</a> players out there downloading it, trying it out, and letting me know what they think, and leave a review.</p>
